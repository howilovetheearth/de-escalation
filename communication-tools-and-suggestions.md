# Communication Tools and Suggestions

* Download the ACLU app for filming and reporting violence to the ACLU.
  * If you're in California, the app is \(as of November 2020\) called CA justice app.
* Identify:
  *  a predetermined and communicated meetup spot and plan in case you have to disperse
  * Exit strategy: pre decided hand signals
* Phone
  * Use Signal \(the application\) and use disappearing messages during the protest
  * Practice turning off your phone, which iw when it's most secure.
  *  Practice initiating the panic/emergency/lock-down mode for your phone.
    * These modes will temporarily disable biometrics \(face/finger unlock\) from working.
  * Take photos and videos without unlocking your device.
  * If the police ask to see your phone, tell them that you do not consent to a search of your device.
    * They might still be able to seize your phone and search it later, with a warrant, but at least it will be clear that you did not give them permission to do so.
* Find legal observers and make sure they know you are a de-escalator. 
* For extra safety have someone -- not in the protest -- know to wait for a message from you after the protest is supposed to be over
  * Check back with them after protest and if they donâ€™t hear from you, then they know to call the National Lawyers Guild. 
* Have the National Lawyers Guild number on your arm so you can call from jail if you get arrested.
