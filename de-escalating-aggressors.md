# De-escalating Aggressors

### Get in the Zone

* A person or persons, who disrupt a protest or line or gathering may or may not be a provocateur. It's important to assess what your move is going to be, then act with confidence and work with others. 

### Assess the Incident



### Respond





### Reflect

*  * If there is a whole row of provocateurs, and you cannot move them out of the way, make a row in front of them and stand calmly and create a buffer between them and the people you are protecting.
  * Make sure you are able to be calm and confident before you approach the disruptor/s.  
  * Check in with your team and if needed form a U formation and walk the disruptors away from the area that might be ignitable into a brawl or verbal assault situation. \(photo will be added later\)
  * You can’t de escalate a person, they de-escalate themselves, you facilitate that process, help them find a way out of that destructive headspace 
    * If that doesn’t seem to happen, or as a step towards that goal, just move them away from the place that is ignitable into a brawl or verbal assault situation, from the protest/action, and to the periphery and stay with them if you can/if it doesn’t bother them, till they subside. 
    * Some may present totally irrational, just help them move on or sequester them in being irrational only to you.
    * Act with attentiveness and care towards them, which sometimes means firm boundaries and sometimes means listening attentively for quite a while.
