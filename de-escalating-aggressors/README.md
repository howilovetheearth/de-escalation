# De-escalating Aggressors

### Get in the Zone

* A person\(s\) who disrupt a protest, line or gathering may or may not be a provocateur. It's important to assess what your move is going to be. Then, act with confidence and work with others. 
* Make sure that you are calm and confident before you approach the disruptor\(s\).  
* Bear in mind that you can’t de-escalate a person. They de-escalate themselves. You facilitate the de-escalation process and help them find a way out of their destructive headspace.

### Assess the Incident

* Can you intervene early?
* Are you at a safe distance?
* Is there a history of assault?
  * Is the provocateur someone you know from the past?
  * If so, what are their known triggers?
* Are they under the influence of alcohol or drugs? 

### Respond

De-escalation maneuver are discussed [here](1.md). This page explains basic guidelines that should inform the execution of any formation.

We can classify the behavior of provocateurs and  adopt a frame of mind in order to respond accordingly.

### Reflect \(DRAFT\)

* **Respect the person – address behavior**
  * If there is a whole row of provocateurs, and you cannot move them out of the way, make a row in front of them and stand calmly and create a buffer between them and the people you are protecting.
  * Check in with your team and if needed form a U formation and walk the disruptors away from the area that might be ignitable into a brawl or verbal assault situation. \(photo will be added later\)
  * If that doesn’t seem to happen, or as a step towards that goal, just move them away from the place that is ignitable into a brawl or verbal assault situation, from the protest/action, and to the periphery and stay with them if you can/if it doesn’t bother them, till they subside. 
    * Some may present totally irrational, just help them move on or sequester them in being irrational only to you.
    * Act with attentiveness and care towards them, which sometimes means firm boundaries and sometimes means listening attentively for quite a while.
