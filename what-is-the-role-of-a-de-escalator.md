_What is the role of a de-escalator?_

De-escalators are responsible for watching the emotional tone of the action.

* They notice persons getting upset, provoking conflict, picking fights, or targeting individuals or groups
  * They assess what approach to take and calmly approach and sensitively attempt to assist people
* They gently keep people informed about legal areas of protest and observe the mood between law enforcement officers and protestors, and between unplanned disruptors and protestors,
* They keep the demonstration as safe as possible from the police and infiltrators and violence.
  * If there is a counter-demonstration, they may serve as buffers between the opposing protestors. 
  * If violence begins to break out, it is the responsibility of de-escalators to intervene nonviolently and calm the situation.
    *  Actually, in such an emergency every participant in a nonviolent action should act as a de-escalator.



* Middle aged women, faith groups, buddhist meditators, older people, can be great  de escalators.
