# Basic De-escalation 1-1

Our goal at peaceful, non-violent public demonstrations \(actions\) is to keep all attendees safe and at ease. Sometimes, a single aggressor hones in on an attendee.

The key idea is to calmly stand between the aggressor and the attendee.

* Draw the aggressor to the side using techniques outlined here \[url\].
