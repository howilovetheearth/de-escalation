# Basic De-escalation 1-1

**broken record/detachment name the behavior directive**

**redirection**

**holding your ground**

**backing them up- from the side move in circle  see this video** [**https://youtu.be/1Wo76xxhizk**](https://youtu.be/1Wo76xxhizk)

**Here are some photos of body language: eyes wide open \(unlike this photo\) but body posture here is super good, arms to the side ready to swipe away any assault but very non threatening in everyway:**  






Our goal at peaceful, non-violent public demonstrations \(actions\) is to keep all attendees safe and at ease. Sometimes, a single aggressor hones in on an attendee. In the event that you can't intercept the aggressor before she reaches the attendee, you should strive to redirect the aggressor elsewhere.

The key idea is to calmly stand between the aggressor and the attendee.

* Approach the aggressor and attendee, attempting to stand to the middle and to the side of them. 
* If the aggressor is particularly loud and the attendee troubled, consider standing in between them.
* Draw the aggressor to the side using techniques outlined here \[url\].
