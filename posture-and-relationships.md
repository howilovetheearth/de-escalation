# Posture and Relationships



### Posture

* Keep your feet shoulder width apart
* Keep good balance and be ready
* Be poised and alert but not menacing and defensive \(do not cross your arms and scowl or stare into anyoneâ€™s eyes\).
* Project polite, calm and confident. 
* Make sure you can step away if someone person swings at you
* If you are comfortable keep your hands up at your sides like this photo so your hands appear non-threatening
  * By adopting a confident nonthreatening posture,  your attitude, volume and tone are likely to also be confident, calm and non threatening.

### Your Relationship to Those Around You

* The smallest unit you should operate in is a pair. 
  * Preferable but not necessary: your pair is in your covid bubble 
* Police Liaisons
  * Police liaisons handle all communication between protesters and the police
    * This helps you focus on your role as a de-escalator
  * If there isn't a police liaison, find someone to fill in that role if possible
    * Usually, a calm and confident older person can fill in the role
  * Do not attempt to de-escalate the police, find a police liaison if there is one.
* Your Group
  * Ideally, work with a group that has trained with you, knows your communication strategies and is aware of the action's security details
    * Try to stay with this group as much as possible
  * Try having an opening circle before and after the event with your group
  * If there is a police line, and if you need to back away from it, try to do it while locking arms with those in your group. Try not to leave anyone behind.
* Action Attendees
  * Tell other protestors, and the organizers of the protest your role is as a de escalator.
  * You are not a junior cop, facilitate, and sequester, and shield, do not tell them off. 
  * Make sure people know the organizers of the protest have designated you as security, so attendees know and trust in why you do what you do
* Provocateurs
  * This is covered starting here
* Yourself
  * If you feel overwhelmed, get help, try not to abandon the situation unless u feel u are adding to the disruption.
