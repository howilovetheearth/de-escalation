# Preparing Ahead of Time

Ideally, ahead of time:

1. Come to de-escalate with a group of trained de-escalators \(e.g. your friends and others in an affinity group\) at a predetermined, designated place.
2. Develop communication techniques
   1. What hand signals will you use to signal for:
      1. Help
      2. Cancelling a request
      3. Spotting something very bad like:
         1. A weapon
         2. Large numbers of counter-protesters
3. Identify gathering spots 
   1. If someone in the group gets lost, where will you find them if you can't reach them by some electronic means!?
4. If you show up last minute and action organizers don't know about advance preparations:
   1. If you attend an action without any prearrangement to de-escalate, find out if there's a tactical team or security team \(and the action's organizers otherwise\). Explain to them your training and affiliation and tell them you want to de-escalate. You could make an instantaneous team at that time.
