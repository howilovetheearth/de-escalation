# Introduction

This is a guide \(currently being drafted and incomplete\) on basic de-escalation techniques at rallies and actions. Its scope is confined to instances of aggression between protesters \(i.e. action attendees\) and other members of the public.

The author of this guide is not the curator of the material here but has been reformatting material that a friend trained in de-escalation [wrote here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RK9NFoGQq1c5m73bau2sO-wJ0fLvSdagVmqmWL8OSGw/edit).

De-escalation in scenarios where individuals carry weapons are not addressed here.
