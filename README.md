# Introduction

This is a guide \(currently being drafted and incomplete\) on basic de-escalation techniques at rallies and actions. Its scope is confined to instances of aggression between protesters \(i.e. action attendees\) and other members of the public.

De-escalation in scenarios where individuals carry weapons are not addressed here.
