# What to Bring

* Extra face mask.
* Hand sanitizer
* Mix water and Maalox \(which is an anti-acid\) in equal doses and have it ready in case of tear gas, for yourself or others. Wrap it in plastic in case it gets damaged so it doesn’t leak all over your stuff in your backpack.
* Water.
* Empty plastic water bottle, always handy for all kinds of things, even if all you just do is offer drinking water without sharing germs.
* Compact food in a plastic bag
* First aid kit if you know there won’t be a first aid/medic at the protest.
* Extra battery for your phone
